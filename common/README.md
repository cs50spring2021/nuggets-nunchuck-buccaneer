# Nuggets Common Directory

This directory holds all the less essential modules for the Nuggets game.
It has the map, grid, mem, playerinfo, pos2D, visibility, gameinfo and file modules
This directory also has all the testing drivers for those modules. 
It can make all the testing in addition to the modules themselves and store them in
a common.a library that is used by the Nuggets program.
